Connected to the server, used ? in place of c and l as directed and switched to the challenge directory using cd. In the directory used /challenge/run to invoke the flag.
```bash
Connected!
This challenge resets your working directory to /home/hacker unless you change
directory properly...
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0R3dsragxuCAuqWlB_HNmuHMWRw.dJjM4QDLykjN0czW}
