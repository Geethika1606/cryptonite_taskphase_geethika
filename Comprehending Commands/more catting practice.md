# More Catting Practice
Linked to the server, used cat to read the contents of the flag given through an absolute path.

You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /usr/lib/git-core/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that
directory!
