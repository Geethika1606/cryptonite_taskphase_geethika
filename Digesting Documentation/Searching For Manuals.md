# Searching for Manuals
Connected to sever, used man man to access the man manual.Then used man -k challenge to find all the commands that reference to man.Then I opened the manual of the output and followed the instructions given in the manual to invoke the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man man
MAN(1)                                                             Manual pager utils                                                             MAN(1)

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page asso‚Äê
       ciated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in  that  section  of  the
       manual.   The  default  action  is  to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the
       first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,
       VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
