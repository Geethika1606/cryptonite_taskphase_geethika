# Position yet elsewhere
Linked to server, ran /challenge/run to find the desired directory and used cd to change to that directory. Later invoked /challenge/run from that directory.
```bash
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /var/log directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /var/log
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/var/log$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
