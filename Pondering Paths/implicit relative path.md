# Implicit relative path
Linked to the servers and changed the directory to challenge as intrusted and then ran the run command as ./run to define explicitly to invoke command from the current directory.
```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kGgmwFRK7f3RaRkL-_mQ8rc45CF.dFTN1QDLykjN0czW}
