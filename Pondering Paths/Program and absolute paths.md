# Program and absolute paths
Connected to the server, gave the challenge in the root directory followed by a run, a file that is a part of the challenge directory. Hence, the code has to work like a textbook where / acts like the index,
challenge acts like a chapter in the textbook, and run acts like a subtopic of the chapter.

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8hG70zJRd9q9Do_3MsQbSbKK9zZ.dVDN1QDLykjN0czW}
```
